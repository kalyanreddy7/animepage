The three get lost in a cave in the outskirts of the Human Territory, ending up at the boundary of the Dark Territory. Alice trips and falls with her hand accidentally touching the Dark Territory. For this violation, she is sentenced to execution by the Integrity Knights. Kirito attempts to stop Alice from being taken away, while Eugeo stands motionless. Soon after, Kirito awakens in the real world with no memory of what happened. Later in Gun Gale Online, Sinon, Kirito, Asuna, Silica, Lisbeth, and Klein confront a mysterious squad that flees after one of them is taken down. After the battle, Sinon thanks the others for joining her, and back in the real world, she invites Kirito and Asuna to join her in the upcoming BoB tournament. They agree, and Kirito reveals that he is working for the Rath Company as a tester for a new Full-Dive technology known as "Soul Translator", or STL. On their way home, Kirito and Asuna are attacked by Johnny Black, the final survivor of the Death Gun incident, who injects Kirito with a poison syringe.</p>
